                                        <p>Kirsten recently awoke to the sounds of screaming. Despite my quickened
                                                pulse, Kirsten suspected an animal.
                                                This
                                                was, after
                                                all, my
                                                Maryland hurricane season home, a wooded property left to the wildlife
                                                most of the year. The screams
                                                were
                                                piercing as Kirsten
                                                gently slid the door open and peered through the screen. It was barely
                                                light but there was no mistaking
                                                the
                                                prominent
                                                silhouette of a fox. It sat upright on a grassy plateau in the backyard
                                                as it threw its head back and
                                                shrieked
                                                its claim
                                                on Kirsten's yard. .......</p>

                                        <p>For this little creature what it’s all about is being wasp, no self
                                                reflection to interfere or confuse that
                                                simple state
                                                of being.

                                                For this writer what it’s all about is realising that original state of
                                                being, before (and after) self
                                                reflection.

                                                And the way to do it is simple, after all is said and done (the need for
                                                experience), stop reflecting
                                                self.

                                                By reflecting something else, or nothing at all. There is a way.

                                                Not easy … ...../p>
